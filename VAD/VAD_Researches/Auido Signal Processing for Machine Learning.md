## Sound and Waveforms

### Sound

- Produced by vibration of an object.
- Vibrations cause air molecules to oscillate.
- Change in air pressure creates a wave.

### Mechanical Wave

- Oscillation that travels through space.
- Energy travels from one point to another.
- Sound is a mechanical wave.

### Waveform

Carries multifactoral information.
- Frequency
- Intensity
- Timbre

### Frequency
Frequency refers to the number of vibrations or cycles of the soundwave per second.
Period (T) :	The amount of time wee needed to elapse before having two pics or dips.

													Frequency = 1 / T

### Amplitude

Maximum displacement of points on a wave . Amplitude refers to the pressure or forcefulness of a soundwave. Another way to describe the amplitude is volume.

## Sound Power
- Rate at which energy transferred.
- Energy per unit of time emitted by a sound source in all directions.
- Measured in Watt(W).

### Sound Intensity
- Sound power per unit area.
- Measured in W/m^2

### Frequency Modulation

The modulation of a wave is variation of its frequency, especially to carry an audio signal.

## Audio Signal

Representation of sound.
Encodes information that we need to reproduce the sound.

	Analog Signal is a sequence of contionuous values for amplitude in time.
	Digital Signal is a sequence of discrete values for amplitude in time.

#### Analog to Digital Conversion
- Sampling
	- Sampling is a process of copying the amplitude values in a specific point in time. We usually determine an equidistance periodic time when we sample the waveform of sound.

	- ![[Pasted image 20230423233832.png]]
	- We have a certain sampling rate which is 44100Hz.
	- Nyquist frequency which is the half of the sampling rate tels us the upperbound frequency that we can have in a digital signal that is not going to recreate artifacts. 
- Quantization
	- The only difference between quantization and sampling is that sampling takes samples of waves in a fixed sized frames in time whereas quantization cares about how accurate the amplitude values in a given time.
	- ![[Pasted image 20230423234742.png]]
	- The higher the quantization (resolution) is the lower the error.
